## Goals

The goal of this project is to create a music box which can play music at the push of a button. It will be an open topped wooden box with a figurine in the middle, a piezo buzzer to play the song and the button to activate the start of the song.

## Onshape Pre-Design 

I Haven't fully finished but I started to design the box on Onshape - [Link to Music Box](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/4070da3629a921a665d7777d/w/15ceae94f1d3e58bcfee66e3/e/b3ec9e57a38d3c9760e5e44e) 

I also found A 3d printing of out ballerina which is your figure head for the project on - [Ballerina](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2679412)

## Psuedo Code

This is the code I'll be using to play the Pink Panther Theme on the music box, I also added the Psuedo code which shows what the code will do on the side - [Code in Arduino Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/wmorela54/9488f8ee-c676-4620-bbf1-e6c64f40eed0/preview)

## Info

I was able to accomplish a working code for playing the music and am almost finished with linking the music start to a button press. We're both close to being done and I expect for us to both finish on time.
